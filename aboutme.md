Hello! I'm Ali, an Ecologist by training and a Data Scientist by aspiration. I live in Colorado Springs, CO.

My background is in Forest Ecology and Biostatistics, which I earned my master's degree in at the [University of New Mexico](https://biology.unm.edu/) in 2017. My first course in R was inspirational, and motivated me to continue learning the program after I graduated. Most of my hobby projects are with ecological data, such as anticipating the spring bud break date of Colorado native plants. I have a few interesting new projects in the works though, so stay tuned! 

When I'm not working as a Lab and Greenhouse Manager at Colorado College or fiddling away in R, I love to trail run with my two Siberian Huskies. I also enjoy reading, rewatching the Office for the 100th time, and spending time with my 8 month old.
