Hello! I'm Ali, an Ecologist by training and aspiring Data Scientist. I live in Colorado Springs, CO.

My background is in Forest Ecology and Biostatistics, which I earned my master's degree in at the [University of New Mexico](https://biology.unm.edu/) in 2017. I'm a statistics nerd and thrive off of translating messy data into informative and usable insights. Currently my hobby data science projects are of the ecological sort, such as anticipating the spring bud break date of Colorado native plants. I have an exciting variety of projects in the works though - stay tuned! 

When I'm not working as a Lab and Greenhouse Manager at Colorado College or fiddling away in R, I love to trail run with my two Siberian Huskies. I also enjoy reading, rewatching the Office for the 100th time, and spending time with my husband and son.
